Hi, everyone. I'm Zjyslav. For 8 years I worked as an accountant and last year I made a move to change careers and become a C#/.NET developer. This change means learning a lot of new stuff.

I've heard many times that the best way to learn something it to teach it and I do enjoy sharing what I know, so I finally decided to create a blog where I will be putting some mini-tutorials and code demos for the topics I'm currently learning or I've learned already, but I want to practice.

Also, this will serve as a handy reference for future me.

Please feel free to do whatever you like with anything here you find useful and learn from any of my mistakes.
